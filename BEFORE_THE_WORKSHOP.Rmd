Welcome to this setup to this Introduction to R workshop. Whether you have used R before or if this is your first time every downloading R, there are a few things for you to do before our tutorial to make sure everything will run smoothly. 


# Downloading the software

We are going to be using R as well as R Studio to make our R experience a bit more user friendly. 

**IF YOU HAVE USED R AND RSTUDIO BEFORE, I WANT YOU TO GO INTO YOUR COMPUTER APPLICATIONS AND DELETE THE PROGRAMS** We are all going to start fresh so we have the most up to date versions and are all running the same things. 

## Downloading R

To download R, we are going to go to the CRAN website [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the newest version for your computer. At the time of creating this workshop the current version is **R 4.3.1** When you have R downloaded, it should open without issues and show you this very not pretty script (Figure 1). Now if this works and looks like Figure 1, great, close R and never open it in this way again.

### Troubleshooting

- Is your computer up to date? 

- Are you downloading the right version for your computer? Mac vs Windows, Intel vs M1/M2? 

- If your computer is older and cannot have the most current software, you will need to download an older version of R that will be supported by your operating system


## Downloading RStudio

In order to make R user friendly, we will be using R Studio to help us run R. This is *technically* optional but I really don't recommend using R on its own, you will have more errors, more difficulty troubleshooting errors and you will have to do a lot more by hand.

To download RStudio we are going to go to the posit website [https://posit.co/downloads/](https://posit.co/downloads/). Download the version for your computer and then open this application when you have downloaded it. If it works you should have a lovely RStudio environment that looks a little something like Figure 2.
